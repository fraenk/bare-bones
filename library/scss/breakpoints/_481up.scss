Stylesheet: 481px and Up Stylesheet

This stylesheet is loaded for larger devices. It's set to
481px because at 480px it would load on a landscaped iPhone.
This isn't ideal because then you would be loading all those
extra styles on that same mobile connection.

A word of warning. This size COULD be a larger mobile device,
so you still want to keep it pretty light and simply expand
upon your base.scss styles.

/*
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT SASS 3.3 & UP
You can't use @extend within media queries
anymore, so just be aware that if you drop
them in here, they won't work.
